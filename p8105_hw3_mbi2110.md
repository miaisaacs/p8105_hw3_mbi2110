Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and
day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall
are given in reasonable units.

``` r
noaa_df =  
  janitor::clean_names(ny_noaa) |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(str_sub(date, 1, 4)),
    month = as.numeric(str_sub(date, 6, 7)),
    day = as.numeric(str_sub(date, 9, 10)),
    prcp = as.numeric(prcp) / 100,
    snow = as.numeric(snow) / 10,
    snwd = as.numeric(snwd) / 10,
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax) / 10,
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin) / 10
  ) |> 
  filter(snow >= 0) |> 
  select(-date)

view(noaa_df)
```

The units for precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth were converted to
cm and the unit for max temp and min temp was converted to degrees C.

For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why?

``` r
noaa_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = snow)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +
  labs(x = "snowfall (cm)")
```

![](p8105_hw3_mbi2110_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
mode_snow <- noaa_df |> 
  count(snow, sort = TRUE) |> 
  slice(1) |> 
  pull(snow)

print(mode_snow)
```

    ## [1] 0

The most commonly observed value for snowfall is 0 because most days of
the year it does not snow in New York.

Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and
in July in each station across years. Is there any observable /
interpretable structure? Any outliers?

``` r
noaa_df |>
  filter(month == 1 | month == 7) |>
  group_by(year, month) |>
  summarize(avg_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_tmax, color = avg_tmax)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ factor(month, levels = c(1, 7), labels = c("January", "July"))) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "plasma") +
  labs(y = "average maximum temperature (°C)")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

![](p8105_hw3_mbi2110_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

It is evident from the two-panel plot that the avg max temp in January
ranges between -5ºC and 5ºC, whereas the avg max temp in July ranges
between 24ºC and 30ºC. There do not appear to be any outliers in either
January or July, although the avg max temps do fluctuate significantly
across the years.

Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
(note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a
plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less
than 100 separately by year.

``` r
plot_i <- noaa_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma") +
  labs(title = "tmax vs. tmin", x = "minimum temperature (°C)", y = "maximum temperature (°C)", fill = "count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

``` r
plot_ii <- noaa_df |>
  filter(snow > 0 & snow < 100) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year), y = snow, fill = factor(year))) +  
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.7) +  
  labs(title = "snowfall distribution by year", 
       x = "year", 
       y = "snowfall (cm)", 
       fill = "year") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

``` r
combined_plot <- plot_i + plot_ii
print(combined_plot)
```

# question 2

Load, tidy, merge, and otherwise organize the data sets. Your final
dataset should include all originally observed variables; exclude
participants less than 21 years of age, and those with missing
demographic data; and encode data with reasonable variable classes
(i.e. not numeric, and using factors with the ordering of tables and
plots in mind).

``` r
covar_df =
  read_csv("data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4, na = c("NA", ".", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (5): SEQN, sex, age, BMI, education
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
view(covar_df)
```

This dataset contains 250 rows and 5 columns and the variables seqn,
sex, age, bmi, education.

``` r
accel_df =
  read_csv("data/nhanes_accel.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 

view(accel_df)
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 1441
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (1441): SEQN, min1, min2, min3, min4, min5, min6, min7, min8, min9, min1...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

This dataset contains 250 rows and 1441 columns and the variables min1
to min1440.

``` r
merged_df =
  left_join(covar_df, accel_df, by = "seqn") |> 
  filter(age >= 21) |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  mutate(
    sex = factor(sex, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Male", "Female")),
    age = as.numeric(age),
    bmi = as.numeric(bmi),
    education = factor(education, 
      levels = c(1, 2, 3), 
      labels = c("Less than high school", "High school equivalent", "More than high school"),
      ordered = TRUE),
    across(min1:min1440, as.numeric)
  )

view(merged_df)
```

The covar_df and accel_df datasets were merged to create the merged_df
in which there are 228 rows and 1445 columns. Those below age 21 or
missing demographic data were removed from the data frame. Sex and
education were set as factor variables, and age, bmi, and min1-min1440
were set as numeric variables so they will be treated as continuous in
analysis and visualization.

Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions
for men and women in each education category. Comment on these items.

``` r
edu_table <- merged_df |> 
  count(education, sex) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) |> 
  rename("Education Level"= education)

kable(edu_table, format = "markdown", caption = "Number of Men and Women in Each Education Category")
```

| Education Level        | Male | Female |
|:-----------------------|-----:|-------:|
| Less than high school  |   27 |     28 |
| High school equivalent |   35 |     23 |
| More than high school  |   56 |     59 |

Number of Men and Women in Each Education Category

The table above shows the frequency of males and females within each
education level. Among those with less than a high school education, 27
are males and 28 are females. Among those with a high school equivalent
education, 35 are male and 23 are female. Among those with more than a
high school education, 56 are male and 59 are female.

``` r
ggplot(merged_df, aes(x = education, y = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma") +
  labs(
    title = "Age Distributions for Men and Women by Education Level",
    x = "Education Level",
    y = "Age",
    fill = "Sex"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
```

The violin plots showing age distribution by sex and education level
reveal that age distributions differ by sex and education level. Most
people with less than a high school education are between the ages of
about 65 and 75 for both males and females. Among those with a high
school equivalent education, the age distribution for males is fairly
even and for females contains more people who are between the ages of
about 65 and 75. Lastly, for those with more than a high school
education, the age distributions show that most people are between the
ages of 25 and 45 for both males and females.

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total
activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men
to women and have separate panels for each education level. Include a
trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences. Comment on your plot.

``` r
total_activity <- merged_df |>  
  mutate(total_activity = rowSums(select(merged_df, starts_with('min')), na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  select(-(min1:min1440))

view(total_activity)
```

Data from min1 to min1440 was combined to create total_activity and the
extra columns were removed for tidiness.

``` r
ggplot(total_activity, aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ education) +
  labs(
    title = "Total Activity vs Age by Sex and Education Level",
    x = "Age",
    y = "Total Activity (MIMs)",
    color = "Sex"
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](p8105_hw3_mbi2110_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

The above scatterplots show total activity in MIMs across age, education
level, and sex. It is evident that for both females and males across all
education levels, total activity decreases as age increases. For those
with less than a high school education, total activity displays a sudden
increase around age 55 and subsequently decreases around age 60. For
those with a high school equivalent education, total activity increases
around age 25 and decreases around age 40, with females achieving
significantly more MIMs than males. For those with more than a high
school education, total activity is more consistent across age with
females achieving more MIMs than males. The distributions for total
activity have large spreads for each education level and sex, and there
appears to be a significant outlier in the “more than high school” group
whose total activity is close to 0 MIMs.

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph;
including smooth trends may help identify differences.
